# Working with me

I've been working with UNIX systems for over 30 years. I have therefore
developed a set of ways of working that are comfortable for me. If you
are a student working with me you would do well to adhere to them.

- I use git for versioning my code.
- I use LaTeX for papers and big documents.
- I used to use emacs as my editor, but have now moved to Visual Studio
  Code. In both cases the editor is good enough for plain text, code
  and LaTeX source.
- I've still not found anything as nice as xfig for pictures. Perhaps
  draw.io, perhaps TikZ in LaTeX, perhaps plantuml.
- I'm a big fan of markdown and <https://pandoc.org>
