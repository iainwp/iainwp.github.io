In English the words "the" and "a" are known as articles and they have subtle but important differences.  In the simplest use they add to the flow of the language.  However, other things matter to get your text right.

- The definite article - *The*.
  
  Use this when you are referring to something very specific.  If an object, then it must be clear that such an object exists and which one of the potentially many it is.  So if I see "the company" in some text, I must know which company is meant.
  
- The indefinite article - *A*.

Use this when you wish to refer to an object, but one of many.  So if you say "A company" then it could be one of any of the companies that exist.

- Example

  *The company is corrupt* here you must have introduced the company in advance and are now saying that it is a corrupt company.
  
  *A company is corrupt* here you must have introduced the concept of corruption in advance and are now saying that one of many companies is corrupt.
  
  Plurals
  
  When a plural is used for something qualified by the indefinite article, then the *A* is omitted.  So we would say as examples
  
  *The companies are corrupt* when some companies have been identifed in advance.
  
  *Companies are corrupt* meaning that a large number of companies are corrupt but not indicating which ones.
