Iain Phillips
=============

I'm (from May 1st 2023) a Professor of Computer Science at Loughborough
University, where I've worked for over 30 years as Research Assistant, Research
Fellow, Lecturer and Senior Lecturer. From Feb 2008 until July 2011 I served as
Head of Computer Science and as a result joined the Council of Profs and Heads
of Computing Committee. I was CPHC Chair from 2012-2014 then the Immediate Past
Chair, then I left the committee.  From 2015 I've been the Director of Academic
Staffing in Loughborough's School of Science and have also acted as Head of
Department from 2016-2018 and May 2022-Jan 2023.

My [official web
presence](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/staff/iain-phillips/)
is rather corporate, but lets you see some employment information and
also useful things like a publication list.

My research is based around the areas of [computer
networking](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/research/research-themes/netsys/)
and high performance computing. 

I maintain a LaTeX class for writing reports, dissertations and theses
at Loughborough: [luthesis](luthesis).
