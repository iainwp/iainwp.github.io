# Laying out the code

- Hard wrap lines at 72 columns.  Modern editors hide this away from you
  but long lines, in my opinion make finding errors difficult and
  sometimes cause more git conflicts.

- indent code at `\begin` except `\begin{document}`
  
- beware of some packages, e.g. comment, that expect a `\end` to start
  on the first column.

## Editors

- Use any editor you like providing the above items can be respected.
  This is not the time for an `emacs` vs `vim` vs `vi` vs `vscode`
  battle.
