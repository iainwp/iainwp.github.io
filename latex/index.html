<h1>LaTeX questions</h1>
<h2>Reducing Whitespace</h2>
<p>(Note that typing texdoc packagename on a Mac or Linux command prompt will give you futher documentation on these</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the title/titlepage - use the <code>titling</code> package</li>
  <li>Around headings use the <code>titlesec</code> package</li>
  <li>To format code listings <code>listings</code>
</li></ul>

<h2>Interword spacing after fullstops</h2>
<p>The eagle-eyed will notice that space between words is a different
  length to that between sentences.  LaTeX distinguishes-interword
  space from inter-sentence space by observing the full stop
  characters.  So an inter-sentence space is placed after every full
  stop.  However, there are exceptions and places where this is
  wrong.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the letter before the full stop is a capital then LaTeX assumes
  it is an acronym, think I.B.M. and NOT the end of a sentence.  To
    fix this use the <code>\@.</code> instend of a simple <code>.</code></li>
  <li>If the full stop does not actually mark the end of a sentence,
    usually e.g. or in someone's initials, say <code>I. W.
    Phillips</code>. Here put a \ between the . and the following
    space. This indicates that this should be an interword space. You
    can also use a <code>~</code> (tilde) character which makes the
    space the same size, but prevents a line break occurring at that
    point, which is often useful.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Errors/Warnings</h2>
<p>It is very good practice to fix all the errors and warnings
produced by latex when compiling a document.  Systems such as Overleaf
and TeXShop often appear to compile the document anyway, but this is
short-term bad thinking as many of your collaborators will use
  different systems.</p>
<p>Some of the warnings are important and having too many will hide
the important ones away.  This will not be good for you in the long
  term.</p>
